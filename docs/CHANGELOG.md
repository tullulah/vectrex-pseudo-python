  - `tests/opcodes/` - Organized by functionality (arithmetic, branch, comparison, data_transfer, logic, register, stack)
  - `tests/components/` - Separated by domain (integration, hardware, engine, memory, cpu)
  - One file per opcode rule with descriptive naming (`test_adda.rs`, `test_jsr.rs`)
- **Standardized Test Configuration**:
  - RAM mapped at 0xC800-0xCFFF for all tests
  - Stack initialized at 0xCFFF consistently
  - Template-based test structure with `setup_emulator()` helper
  - Mandatory verification of registers, flags, memory, and cycles
- **Component Test Categories**:
  - Integration tests for component coordination
  - Hardware tests (PSG, Screen, Shift Register, Timers)
  - Engine tests (Types, DelayedValueStore)
  - Memory device tests
  - CPU-specific functionality tests

### Removed
- **Duplicate Test Elimination**:
  - B register opcodes: 4 duplicates removed
  - Memory operations: 6 duplicates removed
  - Branch operations: 3 duplicates removed

- **Documentation**: Updated copilot-instructions.md with comprehensive test rules and templates

### Technical Improvements
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation between opcode and component testing
- **Discoverability**: Logical categorization makes finding specific tests trivial
