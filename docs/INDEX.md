## Documentation Rules

- All docs must be written in **English**.
- All documentation files go in `docs/`. No `.md` files in the project root (except `README.md`).
- No session notes, bug fix reports, or completion reports. Document what *is*, not what *was done*.
- When a feature is implemented, update the relevant reference doc — don't create a new `_COMPLETE.md` file.
