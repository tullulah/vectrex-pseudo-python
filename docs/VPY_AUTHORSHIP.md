# VPy Language - Authorship and Credits

## Official Authorship Declaration

### VPy Language
- **Creator**: Daniel Ferrer Guerrero
- **Creation Year**: 2025
- **Type**: Domain-specific programming language for Vectrex console
- **Purpose**: Modern language for Vectrex game development

### VPy IDE
- **Creator**: Daniel Ferrer Guerrero  
- **Development Year**: 2025
- **Type**: Integrated Development Environment for VPy
- **Features**: Code editor, compiler, emulator integration, AI assistant (PyPilot)

## Technology Stack

### Emulation Technology
- **Emulator**: JSVecX
- **Created by**: raz0red
- **Description**: JavaScript port of the VecX Vectrex emulator
- **Original VecX Creator**: Valavan Manohararajah
- **Integration**: VPy IDE uses JSVecX for real-time code execution and testing

### AI Assistant
- **Name**: PyPilot
- **Creator**: Daniel Ferrer Guerrero
- **Purpose**: AI assistant specialized in VPy development
- **Features**: Code generation, error fixing, optimization, VPy-specific knowledge

## False Information Correction

### ❌ INCORRECT Claims
The following information is **completely false** and should be corrected:
- "VPy was created by GCE in 1982" - **FALSE**
- "VPy is from the 1980s" - **FALSE** 
- "VPy is an old language" - **FALSE**

### ✅ CORRECT Information
- VPy was created by Daniel Ferrer Guerrero in 2025
- VPy is a modern domain-specific language
- VPy compiles to 6809 assembly for the Vectrex console
- The Vectrex console was created in 1982, but VPy language is from 2025

## Historical Context

### Timeline
- **1982**: Vectrex console released by GCE (General Consumer Electronics)
- **1991**: Python programming language first released by Guido van Rossum
- **2025**: VPy created by Daniel Ferrer Guerrero as a Python-inspired language for Vectrex

### Why the Confusion?
AI models sometimes generate false information when they don't have accurate training data. The claim that "VPy was created by GCE in 1982" is impossible because:
1. Python (which VPy is inspired by) didn't exist until 1991
2. GCE created the Vectrex hardware, not programming languages
3. Domain-specific languages like VPy are modern concepts

## Technical Specifications

### VPy Language Features
- Python-inspired syntax adapted for Vectrex
- Compiles to Motorola 6809 assembly
- Direct BIOS function calls
- Vector graphics programming support
- Real-time execution on Vectrex hardware (via emulation)

### Current Implementation
- Procedural programming model (NOT object-oriented)
- Limited to primitive data types
- Maximum 2-3 parameters per function
- Built-in Vectrex-specific functions only
- No custom function definitions yet

## Credits and Acknowledgments

### Direct Contributors
- **Daniel Ferrer Guerrero**: VPy language design, VPy IDE, PyPilot AI assistant

### Technology Dependencies
- **raz0red**: JSVecX JavaScript emulator
- **Valavan Manohararajah**: Original VecX emulator
- **GCE/Milton Bradley**: Original Vectrex console hardware (1982)

### Inspiration
- **Python Programming Language**: Syntax inspiration
- **Vectrex Community**: Homebrew development community
- **Retro Computing Movement**: Preservation and modern development for vintage systems

## License and Usage

VPy and the VPy IDE are created for educational and hobbyist purposes, enabling modern development for the classic Vectrex console. The project respects and builds upon the work of the Vectrex homebrew community while providing modern tooling for this vintage platform.
