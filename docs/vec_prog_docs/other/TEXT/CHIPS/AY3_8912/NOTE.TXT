In both texts in this directory the registers of the PSG
chips are numbered in OCTAL.

so the numbering is:

octal:             decimal:
   R0  which should  R0
   R1  be read as:   R1
   R2                R2
   R3                R3
   R4                R4
   R5                R5
   R6                R6
   R7                R7
   R10               R8
   R11               R9
   R12               R10
   R13               R11
   R14               R12
   R15               R13
   R16               R14
   R17               R15

Since this might be pretty confusing I changed the registers index's
in my 'VECTREX.TXT' to only use decimals.

HERE they are left as octals, as this is a copy (sort of) of
the original spec sheet of the PSG.
